# Qtile powerlite theme

This is a Qtile configuration with a Powerline look and feel for the panel

![Screenshot](qtile-powerlite-screenshot1.png)

It uses a Gruvbox colorscheme but I plan to make it configurable

## Why?

* Powerline can be heavy at times
* One less daemon to run
* Why not

## Requirements

* Qtile
* a font supporting Powerline glyphs. I tested it with
  * monofur
  * Roboto Mono
  * Source Code Pro
  * NovaMono
* i3lock (I am using a modified version of the wrapper script i3lock-fancy)
* picom (optional)
* nitrogen (but you can also set the wallpaper directly in the conf)
* fontawesome fonts (for the group icons)

## TODO

* different colorschemes
* make it easier to add widgets to the panel without having to care about
  glyphs and colors all the time
* lock screen
